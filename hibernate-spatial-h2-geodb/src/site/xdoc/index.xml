			<p>
				The H2 GeoDB Provider adds support for H2 GeoDB to
				Hibernate
				Spatial. It has been tested with H2 GeoDB 0.3
				and should work with
				any version later than that.
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Important notes"/>
			<ul>
			<li>
				Note that H2 GeoDB does not completely implement the OGC Simple
				Feature Specification.
				Some functions that work for PostGIS or Oracle
				may fail to work for H2
				GeoDB.
			</li>
			<li>
				Note that version 0.3 does not store the SRID with the geometry.
				This is
				due to an omission in the JTS API. Version 0.4 solved this
				issue by
				extending the JTS API, but the fix was committed in the
				opengeo
				repository. To use version 0.4, you have to include the
				GeoTools Maven repository (<a href="http://repo.opengeo.org/com/vividsolutions/jts/1.12-SNAPSHOT/">http://repo.opengeo.org/com/vividsolutions/jts/1.12-SNAPSHOT/</a>) and you cannot use other JTS versions.
